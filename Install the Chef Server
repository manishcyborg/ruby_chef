Install the Chef Server
[edit on GitHub]
There are three configuration scenarios for the Chef server:
• Standalone (everything on a single machine)
• High availability (machines configured for front-end and back-end, allowing for failover on
the back-end and load-balancing on the front-end, as required)
• Tiered (machines configured for front-end and back-end, with a single back-end and loadbalancing
on the front-end, as required)
Prerequisites¶
The Chef server has the following prerequisites:
• An x86_64 compatible system architecture; Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS may
require updates prior to installation
• A resolvable hostname that is specified using a FQDN or an IP address
• A connection to Network Time Protocol (NTP) to prevent clock drift
• A local mail transfer agent that allows the Chef server to send email notifications
• Using cron and the /etc/cron.d directory for periodic maintenance tasks
• Disabling the Apache Qpid daemon on CentOS and Red Hat systems
• Optional. A local user account under which services will run, a local user account for
PostgreSQL, and a group account under which services will run. See
/install_server_pre.html#uids-and-gids for more information.
See the expanded list of prerequisites for a more detailed list of software and hardware
requirements.
Standalone¶
The standalone installation of Chef server creates a working installation on a single server. This
installation is also useful when you are installing Chef server in a virtual machine, for proof-ofconcept
deployments, or as a part of a development or testing loop.
To install Chef server 12:
1. Download the package from https://downloads.chef.io/chef-server/.
2. Upload the package to the machine that will run the Chef server, and then record its location
on the file system. The rest of these steps assume this location is in the /tmp directory.
3. As a root user, install the Chef server package on the server, using the name of the package
provided by Chef. For Red Hat and CentOS 6:
$ rpm -Uvh /tmp/chef-server-core-<version>.rpm
For Ubuntu:
$ dpkg -i /tmp/chef-server-core-<version>.deb
After a few minutes, the Chef server will be installed.
4. Run the following to start all of the services:
$ chef-server-ctl reconfigure
Because the Chef server is composed of many different services that work together to create
a functioning system, this step may take a few minutes to complete.
5. Run the following command to create an administrator:
$ chef-server-ctl user-create USER_NAME FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME EMAIL
'PASSWORD' --filename FILE_NAME
An RSA private key is generated automatically. This is the user’s private key and should be
saved to a safe location. The --filename option will save the RSA private key to the
specified absolute path.
For example:
$ chef-server-ctl user-create stevedanno Steve Danno steved@chef.io
'abc123' --filename /path/to/stevedanno.pem
6. Run the following command to create an organization:
$ chef-server-ctl org-create short_name 'full_organization_name'
--association_user user_name --filename ORGANIZATION-validator.pem
The name must begin with a lower-case letter or digit, may only contain lower-case letters,
digits, hyphens, and underscores, and must be between 1 and 255 characters. For example:
4thcoffee.
The full name must begin with a non-white space character and must be between 1 and 1023
characters. For example: 'Fourth Coffee, Inc.'.
The --association_user option will associate the user_name with the admins
security group on the Chef server.
An RSA private key is generated automatically. This is the chef-validator key and should be
saved to a safe location. The --filename option will save the RSA private key to the
specified absolute path.
For example:
$ chef-server-ctl org-create 4thcoffee 'Fourth Coffee, Inc.'
--association_user stevedanno --filename /path/to/4thcoffee-validator.pem
7. Enable additional features of the Chef server! The packages may be downloaded directly as
part of the installation process or they may be first downloaded to a local directory, and then
installed.
Use Downloads
The install subcommand downloads packages from https://packages.chef.io/ by default.
For systems that are not behind a firewall (and have connectivity to
https://packages.chef.io/), these packages can be installed as described below.
Feature Command
Chef
Manage
Use Chef management console to manage data bags, attributes,
run-lists, roles, environments, and cookbooks from a web user
interface.
On the Chef server, run:
$ chef-server-ctl install chef-manage
then:
$ chef-server-ctl reconfigure
and then:
$ chef-manage-ctl reconfigure
Note
Starting with the Chef management console 2.3.0, the Chef
MLSA must be accepted when reconfiguring the product. If the
Chef MLSA has not already been accepted, the reconfigure
process will prompt for a yes to accept it. Or run chefmanage-
ctl reconfigure --accept-license to
automatically accept the license.
Chef Push
Jobs
Use Chef push jobs to run jobs—an action or a command to be
executed—against nodes independently of a chef-client run.
On the Chef server, run:
$ chef-server-ctl install opscode-push-jobs-server
Feature Command
then:
$ chef-server-ctl reconfigure
and then:
$ opscode-push-jobs-server-ctl reconfigure
Reporting Use Reporting to keep track of what happens during every
chef-client runs across all of the infrastructure being managed
by Chef. Run Reporting with Chef management console to
view reports from a web user interface.
On the Chef server, run:
$ chef-server-ctl install opscode-reporting
then:
$ chef-server-ctl reconfigure
and then:
$ opscode-reporting-ctl reconfigure
Use Local Packages
The install subcommand downloads packages from https://packages.chef.io/ by default.
For systems that are behind a firewall (and may not have connectivity to packages.chef.io),
these packages can be downloaded from https://downloads.chef.io/chef-manage/, and then
installed manually. First download the package that is appropriate for the platform, save it to
a local path, and then run the install command using the --path option to specify the
directory in which the package is located:
$ chef-server-ctl install PACKAGE_NAME --path /path/to/package/directory
For example:
$ chef-server-ctl install chef-manage --path /root/packages
The chef-server-ctl command will install the first chef-manage package found in
the /root/packages directory.
